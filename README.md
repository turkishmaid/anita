# anita

A cooperative library of reusable Python stuff.

This module will be used in `pip install -e` edit mode on my local machine.
- heavily relies on the structure of the local file system which you, intentionally, cannot know
- may use data in $THERE (which you also won't know)
- will need credentials to some magic MongoDB $somewhere (which you also won't know)

So it may simple be not for you. If you decide to use it anyway, you do at your own risk.

> Golden Rule: Don't assume anything you have not seen.
